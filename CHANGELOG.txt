CHANGELOG.txt

v5.1.1 (20150831)
- added check to see if dbConnection object exists, before calling dbDisconnect on it (only for dbUpdateRecord: was throwing errors and aborting lookups)

v5.1 (20150820)
- fixed a bug which prevented correct output when two transcripts were present on one chromosomal location
- fixed a bug that caused peptides with proximal mutations to get incorrect or no processing scores
- fixed a bug where merging two data.tables could result in cartesian joins (joining tables with duplicate 'by' values)
- moved dbConnect calls into tryCatch blocks, so errors during connection establishment are caught as well

v5 (20150723)
- split main code logic into multiple R subscripts for clarity
- refactored some code
- changed script flow to do complete pipeline (lookup, filtering & self-sim) on one SNV before moving to next; output is written to disk after each SNV
- added SNV info to output (ChromosomeID, ChromosomeLocation, Mutant Base)
- (wt->mut) codon change now reported
- (wt->mut) amino acid change now reported
- location of mutated amino acids now reported
- presence of proximal mutations now reported
- epitopes not passing self-sim test are reported in tumor epitope list
- changed perPepAffinityScores (high affinity values simulated) table to perPepAffinityScores_NEW (all affinity values calculated)
- added filter in buildPeptides function, so now only peptides with AA mutations are returned (previously synonymous mutations could be returned)

v4.3 (20141110)
- RNAlikelihood scores now merge based on ENSG, not Gene Symbol

v4.2 (20141106)
- fixed bug where multiple ENSGs on one Chromosomal location weren't handled correctly
- cases where database returns duplicates handled correctly (shouldn't be an issue if database is filled correctly)
- added output of list of peptides not filtered for self-similarity

v4.1 (20141104)
- add wildtype epitopes to self-peptide list for self-similarity checking

v4.0 (20141021)
- extended self-similarity check performed on output peptides
- RNAlikelihood scores included in output list

v3.5 (20141016)
- entries which have proximal mutations are now saved in separate list to allow quantification

v3.4 (20140915)
- optimized code and added some comments

v3.3 (20140915)
- added peptideStart to ProcessingScore lookup query (in case peptide is present multiple times in protein)

v3.2 (20140915)
- multiple mutations in same codon are now handled correctly

v3.1 (20140912)
- refactored code to fix scoping issues

v3 (20140911)
- implemented looking up ENSG and transcribed strand from new table in database (ENSGtoStrand)
- removed dependency on input ENSG & Strand (both now obtained from FASdb)
- script can now handle cases where one SNV returns two (or more) ENSGs/Transcribed strands

v2.1 (20140910)
- removed bug where, in case of one or more proximal SNVs, the mutant codons for the proximal mutations could be constructed incorrectly

v2
- proximal mutations are taken into account (mutations surrounding chromLoc/Pos)
